An event can be triggered on any part of the document by interaction with the user.They do not start or end in one line of code it has a life cyle. They help keep coding user interaction simple which makes it easier for the program to handle.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a type of computer langue, using DOM that uses every section of code in object format. That makes every thing in it an object. This makes programming easier for people to read,write, and learn. Ruby is a object-oriented programming langue that does exactly that.

  Researched answer: referred to as OOP was created to deal with growing complexity. To be able to go in and edit sections of code without causing the entire program to collapse. Using containers allows programmers to do just that, which is all that makes up OOP.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means that a ruby code will always, give a return even if you dont tell it to.

2. PostgreSQL: A type of SQL that is a open source object-relational database management system. This means it useds OOP style programming.

3. Ruby on Rails: A server side web application framework written in ruby. 
It is written in a way ment to be easier and more fun to learn to program

4. ORM: Is object-relational mapping a programming technique, that helps convert data for incompatible sytems. It useds OOP as well.
